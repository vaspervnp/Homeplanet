# HOMEPLANET — working notes

Amstrad CPC 6128 fleet-strategy game in Z80 assembly. Mode 1, 320×200, 4 inks.
The design document is [Homeplanet.md](Homeplanet.md) — it is the spec; this
file is how to work on it.

Written in English because it is an instruction file for tooling. The design
document stays in Greek.

## Commands

```bash
make            # generate tables, assemble, produce build/homeplanet.dsk
make test       # assemble, then run the emulator test suite (~3s)
make run        # assemble and screenshot the running game into build/shots/
make tables     # regenerate the lookup tables only
make dsk-list   # AMSDOS catalogue of the built disc
make clean
```

```bash
python3 tools/run.py --shots 6 --every 5     # a strip of frames, to see motion
python3 tools/run.py --disc                  # boot from the .dsk like a user
python3 -m unittest tests.test_phase0 -v     # one test module
```

**Always `make test` before saying something works.** The emulator gives us
the whole machine state; there is no reason to guess.

## Toolchain

| Tool | Where | What for |
|---|---|---|
| **RASM** 3.2.5 | `rasm` on PATH (source in `~/rasm`) | Z80 assembler, writes EDSK directly |
| **iDSK** 0.20 | `iDSK` on PATH (source in `~/idsk`) | inspect/patch `.dsk` images |
| **cpcemu** | `~/repos/CPCTools/cpcemu` | headless CPC 6128 emulator, Python API |
| **RetroTools** | `~/repos/retrotools` | sprite editor; graphics come from here |

Python 3.14 with PIL. **No numpy, no pytest** — tests use stdlib `unittest`.

### The emulator

`tests/harness.py` wraps it. It is a full 6128: Z80, AM40010 gate array,
MC6845 CRTC, i8255 PPI, µPD765 FDC with real `.dsk` support. The useful part
is that everything is readable — `read_ram`, `peek` (CPU-visible, so ROM
paging shows up), `pc`, `crtc_screen_addr`, `mode`, `decode_screen_ram`,
`screenshot`.

Two entry points:

- `harness.boot_quick()` — boot the firmware, drop `DISC.BIN` at `#4000`, jump.
  Same code path as a real boot minus the FDC. Use this.
- `harness.boot_disc()` — insert the `.dsk` and `RUN"DISC`. Slow; it is the
  only thing that proves the disc image is right.

You can also call any routine directly: poke a stub that sets up registers and
`CALL`s it, `set_pc` there, run a few frames, then read memory. See
`test_fill_rect_honours_width_and_height` — that is the cheapest way to test a
drawing routine, and it is a real unit test of real Z80 code.

Gotchas:
- Two `CPC` instances in one process interfere. One emulator per process.
- It comes up with **cassette** as the default filing system, unlike a real
  6128 with a drive. `boot_disc` sends `|DISC` first.
- `quickload(start=True)` types `CALL &xxxx` into the BASIC line buffer, so it
  only works once BASIC has reached its prompt — and not for us anyway (see
  the boot section below).

## How the thing boots

This is the part that will waste your afternoon if you do not know it.

The game runs at **`#0040`**, and that is forced: two 16K screens at `#8000`
and `#C000` plus the 16K bank window at `#4000` leave nothing else.

But `#0000-#3FFF` is shadowed by the lower ROM. **Writes go to RAM, reads come
from ROM.** So AMSDOS will happily LOAD a file to `#0040` and it will land
correctly — and then `JP #0040` fetches firmware bytes and runs off into the
weeds. The symptom is a program that looks like it hangs, with `PC` wandering
around `#0C00-#1F00`, and nothing in the source to explain it.

Calling `CAS IN OPEN` from a stub does not help either: by the time a binary
started with `RUN"` is executing, the CAS jumpblock has been handed back to
the cassette manager, and the stub sits there printing *Press PLAY then any
key* forever.

So [src/disc.asm](src/disc.asm) builds **one** file, `DISC.BIN`, that AMSDOS
loads at `#4000` in the ordinary way. Its first instructions switch both ROMs
out and block-copy the game down to `#0040` itself. No firmware calls at all.

The game inherits the firmware's CRTC setup (40×25, R1/R6/R9 and friends) and
only ever programs R12/R13. That is normal for a CPC game loaded from BASIC —
but it means starting the emulator on a cold machine and jumping straight in
gives you a CRTC that has never been initialised. `harness.boot_quick` runs
150 frames of firmware first for exactly this reason.

## Memory map

```
#0000-#003F   RST vectors; our IM 1 handler is JP'd from #0038
#0040-#3FFF   code + lookup tables + entity data        (16 KB)
              ...stack grows DOWN from #4000 into the slack
#4000-#7FFF   BANK WINDOW — extended banks 4-7
              sprite libraries, mission data, text, music
#8000-#BFFF   screen buffer B
#C000-#FFFF   screen buffer A
```

Everything touched per frame must live below `#4000`, because the `#4000`
window is being paged underneath it.

`src/main.asm` asserts at build time that code+tables stay clear of the stack,
and prints how many bytes are left. Watch that number.

Banking: `OUT (#7Fxx), #C4..#C7` pages extended bank 4..7 into `#4000`.
`#C0` is the power-on layout. Equates in `src/equ/hardware.asm`.

## Conventions

### Naming

`<subsystem>_<verb>` for routines, `<subsystem>_<noun>` for data:
`scr_fill_rect`, `scr_line_addr`, `sys_boot`, `demo_update`.
Subsystem prefixes: `sys_`, `scr_`, `snd_`, `ent_`, `cam_`, `hud_`, `spr_`.

Local labels start with `@` and are scoped to the enclosing global label.

**RASM is case-insensitive.** `demo_objects` and `DEMO_OBJECTS` are the same
symbol and the build will fail with "there is already an alias with the same
name". Do not distinguish an equate from a label by case alone.

### Register contracts

Every routine's header comment states `In:`, `Out:` and `Uses:`. Keep them
accurate — this is not documentation for humans, it is the only thing standing
between you and a bug like this one:

> `scr_line_addr` used to clobber `DE`. `scr_fill_rect` called it and then read
> its width out of `D`. Every rectangle came out two bytes wide, because `D`
> happened to hold the high byte of the line table. Nothing in the source
> looked wrong.

`scr_line_addr` is now deliberately `AF`/`HL` only, because it is called once
per scanline from loops whose parameters live in `BC`/`DE`.

### Hard rules

- **Never `IX`/`IY` in a per-pixel or per-scanline loop.** They cost 4 extra
  T-states per access and the frame budget does not have room.
- **No firmware calls after boot.** The ROMs are switched out; there is no
  firmware to call.
- The interrupt handler may only touch `AF` and `HL`, and it must save them.
- Self-modifying code is fine and often the right answer — see the
  `@fill_byte equ $+1` patch in `scr_fill_rect`. Comment it every time.

### Frame budget

12.5 fps, one frame per 4 VSyncs, ~265,000 T-states. Section 6 of the design
document has the allocation. When adding to the frame loop, say what it costs.

## Graphics pipeline

Sprites are drawn in **RetroTools**, exported as a `.retrotools.json` project
backup, and converted by:

```bash
python3 tools/rt2sprite.py ships.retrotools.json --out src/gen/spr_ships.asm
```

The converter reads the project JSON, **not** RetroTools' own `.asm` export.
The reason is masks: RetroTools packs its mask at 1 bit per pixel MSB-first
regardless of mode, while Mode 1 data is 2 bits per pixel in the interleaved
`A0 B0 C0 D0 A1 B1 C1 D1` layout. The two do not line up, so the tool's mask
cannot be ANDed against its own data on a CPC. We generate our own mask in
Mode 1 bit order instead.

Output is mask/data pairs, row-major, one block per (frame, pre-shift), which
the blitter consumes without rearranging:

```
ld a,(de) : and (hl) : inc hl : or (hl) : inc hl : ld (de),a : inc de
```

Pre-shifts of 0 and 2 pixels are stored and X is restricted to even positions
(design section 5.1). If a frame has no mask, **pen 0 is treated as
transparent** — pen 0 is empty space in this game's palette.

The converter warns if the project's inks are not the game's four.

### The palette is semantic

| Pen | Colour | Hardware | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Black | `#54` | empty space |
| 1 | Bright White | `#4B` | friendly ships, HUD, text |
| 2 | Sky Blue | `#57` | stars, reference grid, shading |
| 3 | Bright Red | `#4C` | enemies, explosions, alarms |

The `HW_*` equates in `src/equ/hardware.asm` are the **`#40`-`#5F` values you
send to the gate array**, with the colour-select bits already folded in — the
same notation RetroTools prints in its export headers, so a palette copied out
of the editor drops straight in.

> Sending the bare 0-31 colour index instead reads back as `%00xxxxxx`, which
> the gate array takes as a **pen select**. The colour silently never changes
> and you sit there staring at the firmware palette. This already happened
> once.

## Generated files

`src/gen/` is generated and git-ignored. `tools/gentables.py` is the readable
specification for every lookup table; the tests re-derive the numbers from it
and compare against what is actually in the emulator's RAM, so a table that
changes shape fails the tests instead of quietly corrupting the projection.

Tables: `scr_line_lo`/`scr_line_hi` (screen line offsets, two byte planes on
consecutive pages), `qsq_lo`/`qsq_hi` (quarter squares for multiplication),
`sin_lo`/`sin_hi` (8.8 sine, 256 angles; cosine is the same table at
`(a+64)&255`).

## Where the project is

Design document section 13 lists ten phases.

- **Phase 0 — done.** Boot, Mode 1, double buffering, page flip on the VSYNC
  edge, per-buffer dirty rectangles, disc image that boots. 18 tests.
- **Phase 1 — next.** Rotation and projection. The quarter-square and sine
  tables are already generated and tested; what is missing is the signed
  multiply, the 3×3 camera matrix, `recip_z`, and the per-entity projection.

`src/demo/phase0.asm` is the Phase 0 acceptance test running on the CPC
itself. Delete it when Phase 4 puts real entities on screen.
